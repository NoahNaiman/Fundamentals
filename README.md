## Philosophy
Towards the end of my very first technical interview two years ago,
I was asked about Binary Search Trees. I had been getting by the
entire interview by rattling off standard textbook answers about
everything. But when I was asked to actually implement a very
basic and essential data structure, I fumbled hard. And it was
_embarrasing_.

Since then I have become a firm believer in the idea that, if
you truly want to understand something you must take it apart
and put it back together. What I have tried to do with this
project is to create a comprehensive collection of Computer
Science fundamentals. My ultimate goal is to have everything
from ArrayLists to Zippers implemented in here. Hopefully, at
the end of it, the nuts and bolts will be second nature.

This is certainly a personal project, but the code is open
and I encourage you to take a look and assess my implementations.
If you feel I could improve something somewhere, please let me
know!
